## Summary

The assessment of the bike sharing business proposal throws light on the fact that there is a potential opportunity in Des Monies. The analysis of the CitiBike share trips taken in New York reveals that majority of the trips were taken during weekday rush hours between 7am-9am and 4pm-7pm which were used to commute to & from work. The major portion of the users were male subscribers compared to females or unknown genders. We were also able to identify that lower Manhattan was a frequented stop by the users.
Other considerations such as rush-hour traffic in the areas, population concentration, distance to commute are also responsible for the success outcome of the business.

## Suggestions

Two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis would be:

-**Weather conditions:** The weather in the region during the various months would enable to analysi the frequency for utilization of the bike share by the users. The users would be using it when the weather is pleasant to make the trip. An analysis of the relation between the weather and riders behaviour would be beneficial. It would also enable the business to plan their maintenance trips during the off-peak season.

-**Traffic blockage:** Another factor to be considered is the frequency of traffic congestions along with the locations and time frames. It would be valuable because then the business could plan on providing more bikes during rush hour and determine the stops based on the locations. Its more comfortable to ride a bike than wait in traffic for longer period. 

-**Larger Time Frame:** We should also consider the nature of business on a wider range. We can do it by collecting data for over 12 months time to derive at a correct conclusion. The results would enlighten us regarding the number of users for each month.
